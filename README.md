The primary intention of developing this application was to limit the time someone spends on social media. What better way to do it, than an application that has a very wide population base. This application allows people to automate being on Instagram without physically being on it and wasting precious time. It also gives people a verbal description of what they have been missing so they do not have to read the description of every post. Thus, from the usage of Python and several libraries including Selenium, pyttsx3, etc. I was able to develop this application. 

## Getting Started

You will need a Python supported IDE, preferrably PyCharm. The Community Edition can be installed for free. You will also need a valid Instagram account for the purposes of running this application. You will also need a GeckoDriver. This is nothing more than a web browser which is compatible with Python Code so the bot can run. For the purposes of this project, Firefox is used.
